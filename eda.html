								<header>
									<p>One of the first features we considered for our model was a team’s prior passing percentage, since we expected pass-heavy teams to be more likely to pass on a play than run-heavy teams. Therefore, one of the first things we wanted to visualize was what this passing percentage looks like for each team and how it changes over time.  The following plot shows this information.</p>
									<h3>Passing Percentages Over Time by Team</h3>

								<a href="images/passpct.png" class="image featured"><img src="images/passpct.png" style="" alt=""/></a>
								<br />
								<p>These plots also match up with what we might expect to see.  Take the following few plots, for example:</p>
							</section>
						</div>
						
						<div class="row">
							<div class="6u 12u(narrower)">
								<section>
									<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/was.png" alt="" /></a>
									<header>
										<h3>Washington Redskins</h3>
									</header>
									<p>In 2012, with the arrival of rookie RG3, the Redskins switched to a much more run-based offense, and we can see this in the plot.</p>
								</section>
							</div>
							<div class="6u 12u(narrower)">
								<section>
									<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/sea.png" alt="" /></a>
									<header>
										<h3>Seattle Seahawks</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Similarly, Russell Wilson’s arrival in Seattle in 2012 led to a decrease in passing, and we can also see that here.</p>
								</section>
							</div>
						</div>
						
						<div class="row">
							<div class="6u 12u(narrower)">
								<section>
									<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/den.png" alt="" /></a>
									<header>
										<h3>Denver Broncos</h3>
									</header>
									<p>The Broncos’ offense was similarly impacted in 2011 by the change to the more mobile quarterback Tim Tebow, as the spike on the plot shows.</p>
								</section>
							</div>
							<div class="6u 12u(narrower)">
								<section>
									<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/nwe.png" alt="" /></a>
									<header>
										<h3>New England Patriots</h3>
									</header>
									In contrast to these other examples, we can see the consistently high passing rate of the Patriots, consistent with the fact Tom Brady is behind center.

								<h3>Directional Breakdown</h3>
								<p>We were also interested in exploring depth/direction of passes and direction of rushes, so we looked at a few teams’ breakdowns in this regard.  A few examples of these plots are below.</p>
							</header>
						</div>
						
						<div class="row">
							<div class="4u 12u(narrower)">
								<section>
									<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/2013_ATL_Football_Play_Distribution_1.png" alt="" /></a>
									<header>
										<h3>2013 Atlanta Falcons</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Here we can see that the 2013 Falcons, one of the most pass-heavy teams in recent years, were running a lot of short passes.</p>
								</section>
							</div>
							<div class="4u 12u(narrower)">
								<section>
									<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/2009_NYJ_Football_Play_Distribution_1.png" alt="" /></a>
									<header>
										<h3>2009 New York Jets</h3>
									</header>
									<p>The 2009 Jets, one of the most rush-heavy teams in our data set, called fewer passes, especially shorter ones, and opted for a lot of runs instead, especially runs to the right.</p>
								</section>
							</div>
							<div class="4u 12u(narrower)">
								<section>
									<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/2003-2014_Football_Play_Distribution_1.png" alt="" /></a>
									<header>
										<h3>Combined NFL</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Here we can see the overall breakdown for the league, which gives a useful baseline. We can also see that the directional breakdown is fairly symmetric.</p>
								</section>
							</div>
						</div>

					<section class="wrapper style4 container special">
						<div class="content">
							<header class="major">
								<h3>Play Breakdown Throughout the Game</h3>
								<p>Another point of interest is how the breakdown of plays changes over the course of a game. Intuitively, we expected to see different playcalling within the last 2-3 minutes of a half than at the beginning of a half, since the time remaining in a half tends to change a team’s gameplan. To investigate this, we looked at the following plots.</p>
							</header>
						</div>
						
						<div class="row">
							<div class="6u 12u(narrower)">
								<section>
									<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/passprog.png" alt="" /></a>
									<header>
										<h3>Passing Breakdown</h3>
										<p>Here we can see that teams tend to pass more right before the end of the halves, which makes sense, as teams try to conserve time and move down the field before the break.</p>
									</header>
								</section>
							</div>
							<div class="6u 12u(narrower)">
								<section>
									<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/runprog.png" alt="" /></a>
									<header>
										<h3>Rushing Breakdown</h3>
										<p>Here, we see that teams tend to get their ground game going at the start of a quarter before scaling it back, and there’s an increase at the end of the game, probably from teams running out the clock.</p>
									</header>
								</section>
							</div>
						</div>

					<section class="wrapper style4 container special">
						<div class="content">
							<header class="major">
								<h3>Passing Percentage by Down</h3>
							</header>
							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/passyrds.png" style="" alt=""/></a>
							<br />
							<p>These plots show some fairly intuitive ideas.  For example, teams tend to pass less on first down, but pass more if they have longer distances.  Conversely, on third and fourth downs, when a conversion is more important, teams are more likely to pass, especially in longer yardage situations.</p>
