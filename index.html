						<h2>Motivation for the Project</h2>
						<p>Two of the most common adages in sports are, “Defense wins championships,” and “The best offense
						<br />
						is a good defense,” revealing the long-held belief that a strong defense is a crucial element of a 
						<br />
						successful franchise.  In a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/magazine/nate-silver-super-bowl.html">2013 New York Times article</a> discussing his predictions for Super Bowl XLVII, 
						<br />
						Nate Silver supported this with some numbers, noting that the 20 all-time best defenses went 14-6 
						<br />
						in Super Bowl appearances, while the 20 all-time best offenses managed only a mediocre 10-10.  A year
						<br />
						before, <a href="http://freakonomics.com/2012/01/20/does-defense-really-win-championships/">a Freakonomics blog</a> suggested that the adages may be a bit of an exaggeration, but even if 
						<br />
						defense isn’t the most crucial part of a team, 	it is still an important one, and this certainly holds
						<br />
						true in the NFL.</p>
						
						<p>For example, on November 16, 2015, Rob Ryan was fired from his position as New Orleans Saints defensive
						<br />
						coordinator on the heels of a bad loss to the Washington Redskins. Ryan’s career on the defensive side of 
						<br />
						the ball has been less than impressive, as <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/18/sports/football/rob-ryan-fired-by-saints-as-defense-struggles.html">this New York Times article</a> discusses, and it’s natural to ask 
						<br />
						what he, and other struggling defensive coordinators, could be doing differently.  One obvious 
						<br />
						responsibility of a defensive coordinator is to make playcalling decisions against an opponent’s offense, 
						<br />
						which is difficult without knowing what play the opposition will call.  As data scientists, we started to 
						<br />
						wonder if these offensive playcalls could be predicted, based on factors such as field position, time in the 
						<br />
						game, etc.  So in this project, we have decided to undertake this challenge of predicting offensive playcalls
						<br />
						by testing a variety of classifiers on data obtained from Pro-Football-Reference.com.  Our hope is that the 
						<br />
						playcalling decisions of Rob Ryan and other defensive coordinators around the league can be better informed by 
						<br />
						data, and that these classifiers may offer some insight into the playcalling strategies of offenses in the NFL.</p>
