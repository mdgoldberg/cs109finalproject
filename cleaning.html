						<h2>Cleaning and Feature Creation</h2>
						<p>Prepping a dataset for analysis</p>
						<br />
						<p>Due to some instances of missing data from our scraped dataset,
						we were able to create necessary columns and new features with given information, 
						and then, when no longer needed, drop rows where missing data was significant 
						enough to warrant that.  More interestingly, using scraped columns and new indicators 
						created at this stage (such as if the team with the ball was the home team), we were 
						able to generate many new columns that were crucial for our models.  These new 
						features included previous season passing percentage [number of passes per number
						of (pass + run plays)], current season passing percentage, in-game passing percentage, 
						scoring margin, seconds elapsed in the game and half, and timeouts remaining in the 
						half for the team with the ball and its opponent.  Additionally, we created some other
						indicator features that would be essential for modeling, including a ‘RESP’ column 
						(response variable for isPass==True) as well as indicators for down, quarter, if the
						team’s previous play from scrimmage was a pass, if the team with the ball was in the
						red zone, in field goal range, and if it was the start of a new drive.</p>
